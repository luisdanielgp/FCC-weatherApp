## Codepen demo [here](https://codepen.io/Lu_isD/full/JyXmgj/).   
Feedback would be very appreciated!!

## User stories:

- I can see the weather in my current location.

- I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## Code

I used FreeCodeCamp's weather API:  https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me/

I used bootstrap for the styling.

I used Plain Javascript and some jQuery for requesting location and getting the JSON.

# What did I use?

This site was originally coded in Codepen:
- Codepen.io
- Atom text editor for organizing files before uploading to GitHub.
- Google Chrome, specially Chrome's console for debugging everytime my code didn't work.

# Finally

Feel free to take the code and customize it as you wish. It's useful for practicing basic API concepts.

### Thanks for reading.
